# LangBank

LangBank is a Python package for managing a word bank for language learning. It provides functionality for storing words along with additional information such as tags and timestamps.

## Features

-   **Word Bank Management**: Add, retrieve, and manipulate words in the word bank.
-   **Tagging**: Associate tags with words to organize them into categories.
-   **Timestamps**: Automatically record the date and time when a word is added to the bank.
-   **Customization**: Easily customize the file path and storage location of the word bank.

## Installation

To install LangBank, use `pip`:

```bash
pip install /path/to/your/package/dist/langbank-0.1.tar.gz
```

Replace `/path/to/your/package/dist/langbank-0.1.tar.gz` with the actual path to your distribution package file.

## Usage

```python
from langbank import LangBank

# Initialize LangBank with optional file path
word_bank = LangBank(file_path="path/to/your/bank.json")

# Add a word to the word bank
word_bank.add_word("hello", tags=["english", "greeting"])

# Retrieve words added today
todays_words = word_bank.get_todays_words()
print("Today's words:", todays_words)
```
